This is a bash config and a script that makes ur bash chat
with u.

Copy the file named 'say' to ur /usr/bin directory and give
necessary permissions.

Next copy the bash.bashrc to /etc. Or u can copy the contents
to your .bashrc

The config works fine with uxterm (unicode enabled xterm).
It should work fine with other terminals if unicode is
enabled.
